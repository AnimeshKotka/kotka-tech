## Introduction

- Offline data migration to [Simple Storage Service (S3)](../Storage/SImple-Storage-Service-S3.mdx)
- Used when it takes a long time to transfer data over the network
- **Takes around 2 weeks to transfer the data**
- **Snowball cannot import to Glacier directly** (transfer to S3, configure a lifecycle policy to transition the data into Glacier)
- Pay per data transfer job
- Hardware devices for
  - Data Migration (between AWS & on-premise data center)
  - Edge Computing
- Need to install **OpsHub** software on your computer to manage Snow Family devices

## Devices

- <Tag color="#FF5733">Snowmobile</Tag>
  - 100 PB storage
  - Used when transferring > 10PB
  - Transfer up to exabytes
  - Does not support **Storage Clustering**

## Data Migration
- **Provides block storage and Amazon S3-compatible object storage**
- Usage process
  - Request Snowball devices from the AWS console for delivery
  - **Install the snowball client / AWS OpsHub on your servers**
  - Connect the snowball to your servers and copy files using the client
  - Ship back the device when you’re done (goes to the right AWS facility)
  - Data will be loaded into an S3 bucket
  - **Snowball is completely wiped**
- Devices for data migration
  - Snowcone
  - Snowball Edge - Storage Optimized
  - Snowmobile

## Edge Computing
- Process data while it's being created on an edge location (could be anything that doesn’t have internet or access to cloud)
- Long-term deployment options for reduced cost (1 and 3 years discounted pricing)
- Devices for edge computing
  - Snowcone
  - Snowball Edge
- Can run **EC2 Instances & AWS Lambda functions locally on Snow device** (using **AWS loT Greengrass**)
