- Global Service (IAM entities like roles can be used in any region without recreation)

:::note
IAM Query API can be used to make direct calls to the IAM web service (using access key ID and secret access key for authentication)

:::

## Users & Groups¶

- Groups are collections of users and have policies attached to them
- Groups cannot be nested
- User can belong to multiple groups
- User doesn't have to belong to a group
- Root User has full access to the account
- IAM User has limited permission to the account
- You should log in as an IAM user with admin access even if you have root access. This is just to be sure that nothing goes wrong by accident.

:::note
- An IAM Group is not an identity and cannot be identified as a principal in an IAM policy
- Only users and services can assume a role (not groups)
- A new IAM user created using the AWS CLI or AWS API has no AWS credentials
:::

## Policies
- Policies are JSON documents that outline permissions for users, groups or roles
- Two types
  - User based policies
    - IAM policies define which API calls should be allowed for a specific user
  - Resource based policies
    - Control access to an AWS resource
    - Grant the specified principal permission to perform actions on the resource and define under what conditions this applies
- An IAM principal can access a resource if the user policy ALLOWS it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it AND there’s no explicit DENY.
- Policies assigned to a user are called inline policies
- Follow least privilege principle for IAM Policies
- Policy Structure
