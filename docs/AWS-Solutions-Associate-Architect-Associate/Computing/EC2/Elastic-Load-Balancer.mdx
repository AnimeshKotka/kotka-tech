- Regional Service
- Supports Multi AZ
- Spread load across multiple EC2 instances
- Separate public traffic from private traffic
- Health checks allow ELB to know which instances are working properly (done on a port and a route, `/health` is common)
- **Does not support weighted routing**

:::note
If no targets are associated with the target groups => 503 Service **Unavailable**
Using ALB & NLB, instances in peered VPCs can be used as targets using IP addresses.

## Types

### Classic Load Balancer (CLB) - deprecated
- **Load Balancing to a single application**
- Supports HTTP, HTTPS (layer 7) & TCP (layer 4)
- Health checks are HTTP or TCP based
- Provides a fixed hostname (xxx.region.elb.amazonaws.com)

### Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- **Load balancing to multiple applications** (target groups) based on the request parameters
- Operates at Layer 7 (HTTP, HTTPS and WebSocket)
- Provides a fixed hostname (xxx.region.elb.amazonaws.com)
- ALB terminates the upstream connection and creates a new downstream connection to the targets (TCP termination)
- **Security Groups can be attached to ALBs** to filters requests
- Great for micro services & container-based applications (Docker & ECS)
- Client info is passed in the request headers
  - Client IP => <Tag color="#000000">X-Forwarded-For</Tag>
  - Client Port => <Tag color="#000000">X-Forwarded-Port</Tag>
  - Protocol => <Tag color="#000000">X-Forwarded-Proto</Tag>
- Target Groups
  - Health checks are done at the target group level
  - Target Groups could be
    - EC2 instances - HTTP
    - ECS tasks - HTTP
    - Lambda functions - HTTP request is translated into a JSON event
    - Private IP Addresses
- **Listener Rules** can be configured to route traffic to different target groups based on:
  - Path (example.com/users & example.com/posts)
  - Hostname (one.example.com & other.example.com)
  - Query String (example.com/users?id=123&order=false)
  - Request Headers
  - Source IP address

### Network Load Balancer (NLB)
- Operates at Layer 4 (TCP, UDP)
- Can handle millions of request per seconds (extreme performance)
- **Lower latency** ~ 100 ms (vs 400 ms for ALB)
- **1 static public IP per AZ** (vs a static hostname for CLB & ALB)
- **Elastic IP can be assigned to NLB** (helpful for whitelisting specific IP)
- Maintains the same connection (TCP or UDP) from client all the way to the target application
- **No security groups can be attached to NLBs**. Since they operate on layer 4,
they cannot see the data available at layer 7. They just forward the incoming traffic to the right
target group as if those requests were directly coming from client. **So, the attached instances must
allow TCP traffic on port 80 from anywhere**.
- Within a target group, NLB can send traffic to
  - **EC2 instances**
    - If you specify targets using an instance ID, traffic is routed to instances using **the primary private IP address**
  - **IP addresses**
    - Used when you want to balance load for a physical server having a static IP.
  - **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
    - Used when you want a static IP provided by an NLB but also want to use the features provided by ALB at the application layer.

### Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)
- Operates at layer 3 (Network layer) - IP Protocol
- Used to route requests to a fleet of 3rd party virtual appliances like Firewalls, Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS), etc.
- Performs two functions:
  - **Transparent Network Gateway** (single entry/exit for all traffic)
  - Load Balancer (distributes traffic to virtual appliances)
- Uses GENEVE protocol
- Target groups for GWLB could be
  - EC2 instances
  - IP addresses

### Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)
- Requests coming from a client is always redirected to the same instance based on a cookie. After the cookie expires,
the requests coming from the same user might be redirected to another instance.
- **Only supported by CLB & ALB** because the cookie can be seen at layer 7
- Used to ensure the user doesnâ€™t lose his session data, like login or cart info, while navigating between web pages.
- **Stickiness may cause load imbalance**
- Cookies could be
  - **Application-based** (TTL defined by the application)
  - **Load Balancer generated** (TTL defined by the load balancer)
- ELB reserved cookie names (should not be used)
  - AWSALB
  - AWSALBAPP
  - AWSALBTG

### Cross-zone Load Balancing
Allows ELBs in different AZ containing unbalanced number of instances to distribute the traffic evenly across all instances in all the AZ registered under a load balancer.
