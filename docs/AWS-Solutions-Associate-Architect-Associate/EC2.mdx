:::caution
Before Starting EC2, create a budget plan from Bill and Cost management
:::


- Regional Service
- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Stopping & Starting an instance may change its public IP but not its private IP
- AWS Compute Optimizer recommends optimal AWS Compute resources for your workloads
- There is a vCPU-based On-Demand Instance soft limit per region

## User Data

- Some commands that run when the instance is launched for the first time (doesn't execute for subsequent runs)
- Used to automate dynamic boot tasks (that cannot be done using AMIs)
  - Installing updates
  - Installing software
  - Downloading common files from the internet
- Runs with the root user privilege

## Instance Classes

- General Purpose
  - Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
  - Balance between compute, memory & networking
- Compute Optimized
  - Great for compute intensive tasks
    - Batch Processing
    - Media Transcoding
    - HPC
    - Gaming Servers
- Memory Optimized
  - Great for in-memory databases or distributed web caches
- Storage Optimized
  - Great for storage intensive tasks (accessing local databases)
    - OLTP systems
    - Distributed File System (DFS)

:::note
Other type of instances may exist buth only the most important once have been discussed here

## Security Groups

- Only contain Allow rules
- External firewall for EC2 instances (if a request is blocked by SG, instance will never know)
- Security groups rules can reference a resource by IP or Security Group
- Default SG
  - inbound traffic from the same SG is allowed
  - all outbound traffic is allowed
- New SG
  - all inbound traffic is <Tag color="#FF5733">blocked</Tag>
  - all outbound traffic is <Tag color="#008000">allowed</Tag>
- A security group can be attached to multiple instances and vice versa

:::note
Using this we can communicate with new instances without mapping with IPs (in Load Balancing)
:::

- Bound to a VPC (and hence to a region)
- Recommended to maintain a separate security group for SSH access
- Blocked requests will give a Time Out error

## SSH
Using SSH we can connect out ec2 instance.

### Steps to connect:
1. Create a key pair.
    - you can create key pair while creating instance or later create it from Network & Security section and download it.
2. Check security group has rule for SSH. It not then add a new rule for SSH source should 0.0.0.0/0.
3. locate .pem file give to permission using `sudo chmod 400 <your_file_name>.pem`
4. Run this to connect EC2:  `ssh -i "<your_file_name>.pem" <user>@<public_ip>`
