# AWS Outposts: Bridging On-Premises and Cloud with the 7 'R' Strategy

In the ever-evolving landscape of cloud computing, the journey towards migration is often intricate, demanding careful planning and execution. Among the myriad of solutions available, **AWS Outposts** emerges as a game-changer, offering a seamless bridge between on-premises infrastructure and the cloud. In this article, we explore the essence of AWS Outposts and its integration with the **7 'R' strategy**, a framework essential for successful migration endeavors.

## Understanding AWS Outposts: A Hybrid Cloud Solution

**AWS Outposts** represents a groundbreaking hybrid cloud solution by Amazon Web Services (AWS), designed to extend AWS infrastructure, services, and tools to virtually any data center, co-location space, or on-premises facility. With Outposts, organizations can enjoy the same AWS infrastructure, APIs, and operational experience in their own data centers, thereby facilitating seamless hybrid cloud deployments.

## The 7 'R' Strategy: A Framework for Migration

The **7 'R' strategy** serves as a guiding framework for organizations embarking on the migration journey. It encompasses seven approaches to handling existing workloads: **Rehost**, **Replatform**, **Repurchase**, **Refactor**, **Retire**, **Retain**, and **Retrain**. Let's explore how AWS Outposts aligns with each of these strategies:

### Rehost (Lift and Shift)
With AWS Outposts, organizations can seamlessly rehost their existing applications and workloads to the AWS-managed infrastructure located within their own data centers. This enables a "lift and shift" approach, where applications are migrated without the need for significant modifications.

### Replatform (Lift, Tinker, and Shift)
AWS Outposts allows organizations to optimize their existing applications while retaining compatibility with AWS services. By leveraging Outposts, businesses can lift their workloads to the cloud-native environment and make necessary modifications to enhance performance and efficiency.

### Repurchase (Drop and Shop)
While AWS Outposts primarily focuses on extending AWS services to on-premises environments, organizations can still repurchase certain services or applications from the AWS Marketplace and deploy them seamlessly on Outposts, ensuring compatibility and consistency.

### Refactor (Re-architect)
Although AWS Outposts simplifies the migration process by providing a consistent infrastructure environment, organizations may still choose to refactor or re-architect their applications for optimal performance and scalability within the AWS ecosystem.

### Retire
AWS Outposts facilitates the retirement of legacy on-premises infrastructure by providing a seamless transition to cloud-native environments. By migrating workloads to Outposts, organizations can gradually decommission outdated hardware and streamline their IT operations.

### Retain
For certain workloads that require on-premises infrastructure due to regulatory compliance or latency requirements, AWS Outposts enables organizations to retain these workloads while still benefiting from the AWS ecosystem for other applications.

### Retrain
As organizations embrace AWS Outposts and migrate their workloads to the cloud, there may be a need for retraining IT personnel to effectively manage and optimize the hybrid environment. AWS provides comprehensive training and certification programs to upskill personnel and ensure smooth operations.

## Conclusion

AWS Outposts revolutionizes the cloud migration journey by offering a seamless bridge between on-premises infrastructure and the AWS cloud. By aligning with the **7 'R' strategy**, organizations can strategically plan their migration approach and leverage Outposts to achieve their goals efficiently. Whether it's rehosting existing workloads, refactoring applications for optimal performance, or retaining specific workloads on-premises, AWS Outposts empowers organizations to embrace the hybrid cloud paradigm with confidence and agility.
