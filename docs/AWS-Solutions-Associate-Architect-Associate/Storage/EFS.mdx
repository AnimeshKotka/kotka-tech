- AWS managed Network File System (NFS)
- Can be mounted to multiple EC2 instances **across AZs**
- **Pay per use** (no capacity provisioning)
- **Auto scaling** (up to PBs)
- Compatible with **Linux** based AMIs (**POSIX** file system)
- **Uses security group to control access to EFS**
- Lifecycle management feature to move files to **EFS-IA** after N days

## Performance Mode
- **General Purpose** (default)
  - latency-sensitive use cases (web server, CMS, etc.)
- **Max I/O**
  - higher latency & throughput (big data, media processing)

## Throughput Mode
 ### Bursting (default)
  - Throughput: 50MB/s per TB
  - Burst of up to 100MB/s.
 ### Provisioned
 - Fixed throughput (provisioned)
 ### Elastic
  - auto scales throughput up or down based workloads
  - up tp 3GB/s for read and 1 GB/s for writes
  - Used for unpredictable workloads

## Storage Classes
- Standard - for frequently accessed files
- Infrequent access (EFS-IA) - cost to retrieve files, lower price to store
-  Archive- rarely accessed data (few times each year), 50% cheaper
- Implement **Lifecycle policies** to move files between storage tiers

## Security
- EFS Security Groups to control network traffic
- POSIX Permissions to control access from hosts by IAM User or Group
