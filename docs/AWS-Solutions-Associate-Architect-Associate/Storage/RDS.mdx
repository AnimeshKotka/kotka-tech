### Indroduction

- Regional Service
- Supports Multi AZ
- AWS Managed SQL Database
- Supported Engines
  - Postgres
  - MySQL
  - MariaDB
  - Oracle
  - Microsoft SQL Server
  - Aurora (AWS Proprietary database)
- [Backed by Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) storage](../Computing/EC2/EC2.mdx)
- We don't have access to the underlying instance
- **DB connection is made on port 3306**
- Security Groups are used for network security (must allow incoming TCP traffic on port 3306 from specific IPs)

### Backups

- **Automated Backups** (enabled by default)
  - Daily full backup of the database (during the defined maintenance window)
  - Backup retention: 7 days (max 35 days)
  - Transaction logs are backed-up every 5 minutes (point in time recovery)
- DB Snapshots:
  - Manually triggered
  - Backup retention: unlimited

### Auto Scaling

- Automatically scales the RDS storage within the max limit
- Condition for automatic storage scaling:
  - Free storage is less than 10% of allocated storage
  - Low-storage lasts at least 5 minutes
  - 6 hours have passed since last modification

### Read Replicas
- Allows us to scale the read operation (SELECT) on RDS
![Read Replicas](/img/rds-replica.jpg)
- **Up to 5 read replicas** (within AZ, cross AZ or cross region)
- **Asynchronous Replication** (seconds)
- **Replicas can be promoted to their own DB**
- **Applications must update the connection string to leverage read replicas**
- Network fee for replication
  - Same region: free
  - Cross region: paid

:::note
You can create a read replica as a Multi-AZ DB instance. A standby of the replica will be created in another AZ for failover support for the replica.
:::

### Multi AZ
- Increase availability of the RDS database by replicating it to another AZ
![Multi AZs](/img/rds-multi-az.jpg)
- **Synchronous Replication**
- **Connection string does not require to be updated** (both the databases can be accessed by one DNS name, which allows for automatic DNS failover to standby database)
- When failing over, **RDS flips the CNAME** record for the DB instance to point at the standby, which is in turn promoted to become the new primary.
- **Cannot be used for scaling as the standby database cannot take read/write operation**

### Encryption
- **At rest encryption**
  - KMS AES-256 encryption
  - Encrypted DB => Encrypted Snapshots, Encrypted Replicas and vice versa
- **In flight encryption**
  - **SSL certificates**
  - Force all connections to your DB instance to use SSL by setting the `rds.force_ssl` parameter to `true`
  - To enable encryption in transit, download the AWS-provided root certificates & used them when connecting to DB
- To encrypt an un-encrypted RDS database:
  - Create a snapshot of the un-encrypted database
  - Copy the snapshot and enable encryption for the snapshot
  - Restore the database from the encrypted snapshot
  - Migrate applications to the new database, and delete the old database
- To create an encrypted cross-region read replica from a non-encrypted master:
  - Encrypt a snapshot from the unencrypted master DB instance
  - Create a new encrypted master DB instance
  - Create an encrypted cross-region Read Replica from the new encrypted master

### Access Management
- Username and Password can be used to login into the database
- EC2 instances & Lambda functions should access the DB using IAM DB Authentication (AWSAuthenticationPlugin with IAM) - token based access
  - EC2 instance or Lambda function has an IAM role which allows is to make an API call to the RDS service to get the **auth token** which it uses to access the MySQL database.
  - ![Multi AZs](/img/rds-iam.jpg)
  - Only works with **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**
  - Auth token is valid for 15 mins
  - Network traffic is encrypted in-flight using SSL
  - **Central access management** using IAM (instead of doing it for each DB individually)
- EC2 & Lambda can also get DB credentials from SSM Parameter Store to authenticate to the DB - credentials based access

### RDS Events
- RDS events only provide operational events on the DB instance (not the data)
- To capture data modification events, use **native functions** or **stored procedures** to invoke a **Lambda** function.

### Monitoring
- **CloudWatch Metrics for RDS**
  - Gathers metrics from the **hypervisor** of the DB instance
    - CPU Utilization
    - Database Connections
    - Freeable Memory
- **Enhanced Monitoring**
  - Gathers metrics from an agent running on the RDS instance
    - OS processes
    - RDS child processes
  - Used to monitor different **processes or threads on a DB instance** (ex. percentage of the CPU bandwidth and total memory consumed by each database process in your RDS instance

### Maintenance & Upgrade
:::note
Any database engine level upgrade for an RDS DB instance with Multi-AZ deployment triggers both the primary and standby DB instances to be upgraded at the same time.
This causes downtime until the upgrade is complete.
This is why it should be done during the maintenance window.
