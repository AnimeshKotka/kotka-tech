### Indroduction

- Regional Service
- AWS managed caching service
- **In-memory key-value** store with **sub-millisecond latency**
- Need to provision an underlying EC2 instance
- **Makes the application stateless** because it doesnâ€™t have to cache locally
- **Using ElastiCache requires heavy application code changes** (setup the application to query the cache before and after querying the database)
- Usage:
  - **DB Cache** (lazy loading): cache read operations on a database (reduced latency)
  - **Session Store**: store user's session data like cart info (allows the application to remain stateless)
  - **Global Data Store**: store intermediate computation results

### Redis vs Memcached

Redis | Memcached 
--- | --- 
In-memory data store | Distributed memory object cache
 Read Replicas (for scaling reads & HA)	| No replication
Backup & restore	| No backup & restore
Single-threaded	| Multi-threaded
Data is stored in an in-memory DB which is replicated	| Data is partitioned across multiple nodes (sharding)
Redis Sorted Sets are used in realtime Gaming Leaderboards	|
Good for auto-completion	|
Multi-AZ support with automatic failover (disaster recovery)	

### Security & Access Management
- Network security is managed using **Security Groups** (only allow EC2 security group for incoming requests)
- At rest encryption using KMS
- In-flight encryption using SSL
- Use Redis Auth to authenticate to ElastiCache for Redis
- Memcached supports SASL-based authentication
