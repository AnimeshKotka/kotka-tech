## Elastic Block Storage volumes

- Volume **Network Drive** (provides low latency access to data)
- Can only be mounted to 1 instance at a time (except EBS multi-attach)
- <Tag color="#FF5733">Bound to an AZ</Tag>
- Must provision capacity in advance (size in GB & throughput in IOPS)
- By default, upon instance termination, the root EBS volume is deleted and any other attached
  EBS volume is not deleted (can be over-ridden using `DeleteOnTermination` attribute)
- To replicate an EBS volume across AZ or region, need to copy its snapshot
- EBS Multi-attach allows the same EBS volume to attach to multiple EC2 instances **in the same AZ**


## Volume Types
### General Purpose SSD
- Cost effective storage, low latency, Dev and test env
- Good for system boot volumes, virtual desktops
- Storage: 1 GB - 16 TB
- **gp3**
  - newer gen version
  - **3,000 lOPS baseline** (max 16,000 - independent of size)
  - 125 MiB/s throughput (max 1000MiB/s - independent of size)
  - independently can set the IOPs and throughput
- **gp2**
  - **Burst IOPS up to 3,000**
  - **3 IOPS per GB**
  - **Max IOPS: 16,000** (at 5,334 GB)

### Provisioned IOPS SSD
- Optimized for **Transaction-intensive Applications** with high frequency of **small & random IO operations**. They are sensitive to increased I/O latency.
- Maintain high IOPS while keeping I/O latency down by maintaining a **low queue length** and a high number of IOPS available to the volume.
- **Supports EBS Multi-attach** (not supported by other types)
- **io1** & **io2**
  - Storage: **4 GB - 16 TB**
  - Max IOPS: **64,000 for Nitro EC2 instances & 32,000 for non-Nitro**
  - **50 lOPS per GB** (64,000 IOPS at 1,280 GB)
  - io2 have more durability and more IOPS per GB (at the same price as io1)
- io2 Block Express
  - Storage: 4 GiB - **64 TB**
  - Sub-millisecond latency
  - Max IOPS: 256,000
  - 1000 lOPS per GB

### Hard Disk Drives (HDD)
- Optimized for **Throughput-intensive Applications** that require **large & sequential IO** operations and
  are less sensitive to increased I/O latency (big data, data warehousing, log processing)
- Maintain high throughput to HDD-backed volumes by maintaining a high queue length when performing large, sequential I/O
- Cannot be used as boot volume for an EC2 instance
- Storage: 125 MB - 16 TB
- **Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)**
  - Optimized for large sequential reads and writes (Big Data, Data Warehouses, Log Processing)
  - Max throughput: 500 MB/s
  - Max IOPS: 500
- Cold HDD (sc1)
  - For infrequently accessed data
  - Cheapest
  - Max throughput: 250 MB/s
  - Max IOPS: 250

### Encryption
- Optional
- For Encrypted EBS volumes
  - Data at rest is encrypted
  - **Data in-flight between the instance and the volume is encrypted**
  - All snapshots are encrypted
  - All volumes created from the snapshot are encrypted
- Encrypt an un-encrypted EBS volume
  - Create an EBS snapshot of the volume
  - Copy the EBS snapshot and encrypt the new copy
  - Create a new EBS volume from the encrypted snapshot (the volume will be automatically encrypted)

:::note
All EBS types and all instance families support encryption but not all instance types support encryption.

### Snapshots
 - **Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM)** can be used to automate the creation, retention, and deletion of snapshots of EBS volumes
 - Snapshots are incremental
 - Only the most recent snapshot is required to restore the volume

### RAID
- RAID 0
  - Improve performance of a storage volume by distributing reads & writes in a stripe across attached volumes
  - If you add a storage volume, you get the straight addition of throughput and IOPS
  - For high performance applications
- RAID 1
  - Improve data availability by mirroring data in multiple volumes
  - For critical applications
